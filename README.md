### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a trained cancer researcher with customer success experience in digital health care and a passion for data. Now I am ready to take steps and make data a bigger part of my work life. 
In my career, I have always generated and worked with data. In recent times, I even created dashboards for our clinical clients. Work that I enjoyed doing. I brushed up my SQL knowledge and took the IBM Data Science specification. The foundation is laid out. Now I have to maintain and train the muscle.
